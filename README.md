 # About
If you’ve ever tried to communicate with someone who only spoke a foreign language, you know that it can be extremely difficult. We decided to work on a translator that not only supports voice recognition and native speaker playback, but is also capable of translating between thousands of language pairs. It leverages Raspberry PI, free translation APIs, and some open source software.
